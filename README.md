# Trending arXiv

Keep track of arXiv papers and the tweet mini-commentaries that your friends are discussing on Twitter.

[Check out my tailored version of it at http://trendingarxiv.smerity.com/](http://trendingarxiv.smerity.com/)

To run:

+ Set up the config file with Twitter API credentials and Twitter users to follow
+ Install Python requirements
+ Create database (`python create_db.py`)
+ Run development server (`run_dev_server.sh`)
+ Refresh to follow your friends :)

**Warning:** This is quickly constructed, minimally vetted, and likely to burn your house down whilst insulting your physical prowess and your GPU's heat output. You've been warned. Have fun! ^\_^
